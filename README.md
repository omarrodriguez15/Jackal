# Jackal
A BlackJack simulator. The goal of this is to play around with .Net core on Mac. Also to explore different Blackjack
strategies.

#Currently
The main logic for player actions is mostly done. The plan is to make it easy to swap out strategies to determine
when to hit and when to stay. All that is left is what to do on doubles. 

A real betting strategy is not in place yet I am just betting 5 each round.
